summary: Spontaneous belief understanding at age 2 years predicts explicit theory of mind at 3 years - A replication study and longitudinal data analysis
abstract: "Despite several decades of research examining young children's performance on spontaneous (non-elicited, looking time) measures of theory of mind, relations between early looking time measures of social cognition and explicit, verbal measures in preschool remain unclear. This study (N=214) evaluates a spontaneous belief task in 2-year-olds, and examines relations between spontaneous belief and concurrent explicit ToM-relevant cognition (e.g., pretense) and later explicit ToM at 3-years-old (N=159)."
